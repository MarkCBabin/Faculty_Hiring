# Faculty_Hiring
For reformatting Google Forms (output as a .csv) into a format that I want for this. 
NOTE: THIS WAS BUILT IN PYTHON 2.7
This file runs from command line and require input as follows:

python Faculty_Hiring.py [file_name_to_be_read] First_name Last_name
example:
python Faculty_Hiring.py Mark_Babin Mark Babin

Note: [file_name_to_be_read] MUST be a .csv file and in the same directory (i.e. folder) as the python script! Do not include ".csv" in the input - it is assumed in the code.

The output will be a .txt file of the same name as [file_name_to_be_read] and in the same directory. There is no formatting (i.e. bold/bulleted text), as python does not do this well. It is still easily read as a .txt or easily copied to Word where you can bold the ~15 titles in little-to-no time.

Any questions\comments can be directed to markcbabin@gmail.com
